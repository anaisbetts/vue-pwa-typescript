# vue-pwa-typescript

This repo is a port of the `pwa` template from Vue 2.5, made to work with Babel 7.x and in particular, [@babel/preset-typescript](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-preset-typescript) for TypeScript support. This means that TypeScript will pass through and use babel-preset-env for its code generation.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

```
